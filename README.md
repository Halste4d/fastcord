# fastcord
FastCord is a Nodejs CLI application that aims to make the creation of bot for Discord more practical.

The use of this application is simple, after having cloned / downloaded this repository on your computer. You will run the node index.js command on your terminal and answer the questions, then your bot folder will be created.

Remember: after creating the bot folder, access it from the terminal and run the npm init -y and npm i commands to install the dependencies.
